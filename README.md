# Youtube Trending Video Data Analysis
This project was developed as a part of CMPE 255 course.

### Data Description:
This dataset includes several months (and counting) of data on daily trending YouTube videos. Data is included for the US, GB, DE, CA, FR, RU, MX, KR, JP and IN regions (USA, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, France, Russia, Mexico, South Korea, Japan and India respectively), with up to 200 listed trending videos per day.

Each regionâ€™s data is in a separate file. Data includes the video title, channel title, publish time, tags, views, likes and dislikes, description, and comment count.

The data also includes a category_id field, which varies between regions. To retrieve the categories for a specific video, find it in the associated JSON. One such file is included for each of the five regions in the dataset.
